Ruby script for calcultating effectiveness of Phase vs. Shiled Spell

I hate the spell "Phase" from Grimlores Grimoire. Basically because one of my players survived a certain death (or some'ng) from a Banshee bc. he cast this ridiculous spell.

I want to see if Shield or Phase is most efficient

(I may be biased here and annoyed).
